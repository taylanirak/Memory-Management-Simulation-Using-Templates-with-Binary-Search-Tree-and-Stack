# Memory-Management-Simulation-Using-Templates-with-Binary-Search-Tree-and-Stack
Description

This project is a C++ program designed to simulate memory management using templates, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), stacks, and operator overloading. The program allocates and manages different variable types (int, short, and char) in separate memory spaces. It demonstrates memory allocation, variable definition, and memory deallocation using templated data structures.

Features

Implements templated Binary Search Tree (BST) for managing memory blocks.

Implements templated Stack for variable storage in each memory block.

Provides operator overloading for commands such as allocation (+), deallocation (-), variable definition (<<), and variable deletion (>>).

Ensures memory safety by checking for overlaps and maintaining LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) properties for stacks.

Supports commands to display the current memory allocations and variables.
